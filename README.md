## How to Build

- Ubuntu

In `ubuntu`,you can easily build it by `.install.sh`.

1.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/SivilTaram/BUAAOS-guide-book.git
```
2.
```shell
cd BUAAOS-guide-book
chmod a+x .install.sh
```
3.
```shell
./.install.sh
```
And then you have all environments for building it.

If you want to build it,you can do as follow:
```shell
cd guide-book
make
```

And then you will get a `guide-book.pdf` in you directory `guide-book`.

- Windows:

You can use `xelatex -shell-escape -8bit guide-book.tex` twice in directory `guide-book`, and you can get `guide-book.pdf`ã€‚

*Note: You should add `\setCJKmainfont{font-name}` to `guide-book.tex` as a result of loss of default zh-fonts in windows.*

## How to Auto-Build and Upload

If you fork and pull request, you can push as follow:

```shell
git tag -a v1.1.1 -m "tags content"
git push --tags
git push
```

The `v1.1.1` is the version number of guide-book.

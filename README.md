## How to Build

### Ubuntu

In `ubuntu`,you can easily build it by `.install.sh`.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SivilTaram/BUAAOS-guide-book.git
cd BUAAOS-guide-book
chmod a+x .install.sh
```
And then you can run `.install.sh` to install the all environments.

```shell
./.install.sh
```
And then you have all environments for building it.

If you want to build it,you can do as follow:
```shell
cd guide-book
make
```

And then you will get a `guide-book.pdf` in you directory `guide-book`.

### Windows

You can use `xelatex -shell-escape -8bit guide-book.tex` twice in directory `guide-book`, and you can get `guide-book.pdf`ã€‚

**Note: You should add `\setCJKmainfont{font-name}` to `guide-book.tex` as a result of loss of default zh-fonts in windows.**

## How to Contribute

If you find any `bug` or `wrong`, welcome to fork and pull request. 

If you just want to commit something but it may bring failure, you can commit as follow:

```shell
git commit -m "[ci skip] xxxx"
```

If your change to it can make build success, you can push as follow:

```shell
git tag -a v1.1.1 -m "tags content"
